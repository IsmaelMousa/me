## Who Am I?

My name is Ismael Ramzi Mousa, born on July 19, 2003, in Nablus/Palestine. I'm a student specializing in AI and Data Science, with nearly two years of software development experience. I'm a self-motivated learner with a keen eye for detail and enjoy working in team settings where I can both share my knowledge and learn from others. In my personal time, I focus on enhancing my Machine Learning skills.

### Educational Background

My academic journey began at an industrial high school, where I specialized in Electricity and graduated with
honors, securing the top position in my specialty. This early exposure ignited my passion for technology and AI,
motivating me to pursue further studies in Computer Science with a focus on AI
at [An-Najah National University](https://www.najah.edu/en/#).

### Continuous Learning

I actively seek out opportunities to expand my expertise and engage in projects that drive
innovation in AI and related domains. I am deeply committed to staying updated with the latest advancements and methodologies
in the field.

### Interests and Hobbies

Passionate about sports science and its impact on mental health and life decisions. I enjoy delving into foreign cultures and linguistic nuances, with a particular fondness for Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.

I love movies.
